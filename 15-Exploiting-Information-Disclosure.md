# Information Disclosure

# Exploiting Error Messages
- some application gives large error message when submit this unexpected input, gives error with debug message that may contain some information about back-end infrastructure

# Script Error Messages
- when error arise in an interpreted web scripting language, i.e VBScript, Ruby, python etc
- this error typically does not contain any sensitive information about the state of the application or data being Processed, but it help us to narrow down the focus of attack

# Stack Traces
- when error occur, in application it gives us full `stack trace` of the error, which gives actual description of the error, why they arise etc

# Informative Debug Messages
- following items are commonly included in verbose debug messages
	- values of key session variables that can be manipulated via user input
	- Hostnames and credentials for back-end components as Database
	- file and Directory names on server
	- Information embedded with meaningful session tokens
	- Encrypted keys used for exception arising in native code components, including values of CPU registers, content of stack, list of loaded DLL etc

# Server and Database Messages
- some time error message are returned by some back-end component also such as `Database`, `SOAP server` etc
## Using Information disclosure to Advance attack

### HACK Step:
 1. When probing application for common vulnerabilities by submitting crafted attack strings in different parameters, always monitor application's responses to identify any error messages that may contain useful information-- attempt force error response from the application by supplying encrypted data string in the  wrong context, or by performing actions on resource that are not in the correct state to handle the action
 2. some error information returned within server's response may not be rendered on-screen within the browser, search each raw response for keyword that are often contained in error message
```bash
 error
 exception
 illegal
 invalid
 fail
 stack
 access
 directory
 file
 not found
 varchar
 ODBC
 SQL
 SELECT
```
 3. When you send a series of requests modifying parameters within a base request, check whether the original response already contains any of the keywords you are looking for to avoid false  Positives.
 4. You can use the Grep function of Burp Intruder to quickly identify any occurrences of interesting keywords in any of the responses generated by a given attack 

## Using public Information
### HACK STEP
  1. search for the text of any unusual error messages using standard search engines like google. we use various dorking feature to narrow down our result eg. `"unsble to retrive" filetype:php`
  2. Review the search results, looking for any discussion about the error message and for any other websites in which the same message has been appeared

  ## Engineering Informative Error Messages
  - some time we understand why error cause and craft a payload acc. to that.
  - some times our user input may execute in server side but the result is given in the stack trace or error 

## Gathering Published Information
- some list of potentially sensitive information that applications often publish to users
	- list of Valid usernames, account numbers and document IDs
	- user profile details, including user roles and privileges, data of last login and account status
	- the current user's password (in source code)
	- log files that containing information such as usernames, URL, action performed, session tokens, and Database queries
	- application details in client side HTML i.e commented-out links, form fields , comment about bugs

## using inference
- a registration functions that enables us to enumerate registered user-names on the basis of error message when existing username is chosen
- A search engine that allows us to infer the contents of indexed documents that we are not authorized to view directly
- A blind SQL injection vulnerability in which we alter application's behavior
